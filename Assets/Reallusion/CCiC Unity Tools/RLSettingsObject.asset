    2.1.1\r\n- Unity 6.3 fixes.\r\n- Import blendshape normals set to calculate by

    Eyelash and Brows shadow and reflection fixes.\r\n- Bone driver script added.\r\n   
    - For exports with bone/expression data (CC4.63 / CC5.0+).\r\n    - Script will
    drive face bones from the facial expression blendshapes on the body mesh.\r\n   
    - Script will also copy facial expression blendshapes from the body to other
    relevant meshes.\r\n    - Facial expression blendshapes need only target the
    body and driver script takes care of the rest.\r\n    - Optional expression strength
    controls.\r\n    - Animations retargeted to characters with active bone driver
    scripts have the driven blendshapes and bones stripped from the animation, significantly
    reducing size and improving playback performance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soupday/CCiC-Unity-Tools/releases/268901671/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soupday/CCiC-Unity-Tools/releases/250302395","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soupday/CCiC-Unity-Tools/releases/250302395/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/soupday/CCiC-Unity-Tools/releases/250302395/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/soupday/CCiC-Unity-Tools/releases/tag/2.1.0","id":250302395,"author":{"login":"soupday","id":79094830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDk0ODMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79094830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soupday","html_url":"https://github.com/soupday","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soupday/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soupday/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soupday/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soupday/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soupday/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soupday/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soupday/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soupday/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soupday/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOL2lAh84O60-7","tag_name":"2.1.0","target_commitish":"main","name":"CC/iC

    Unity Pipeline Plugin'' (https://github.com/soupday/CCIC-Unity-Pipeline-Plugin)
    for both Character Creator (versions 4 & 5) and iClone.\r\n    - Allows the direct
    import of Characters, props cameras, lights and full iClone scenes into a Unity
    project with a single button click.\r\n    - All exports can automatically be
    placed directly into a Unity scene and added to a Unity Timeline to allow direct
    replication of an iClone scene in Unity.\r\n    - Animated cameras (positions,
    camera tracking and switching [using the switcher track], depth of field, focus
    distance) and lights (positions, color, intensity, ranges, angles and activation
    state) can also be automatically set up in a Unity Timeline.\r\n    - Datalink
    is not limited to a local machine, a remote host using iClone/Character Creator
    can be connected to (Unity 2021 and above).\r\n- TBD:\r\n    - URP Anisotropic
    hair.\r\n    - Tessellation shaders for URP (Skin only for now)\r\n    - Retarget
    expressions to/from CC5 HD profile.\r\n    - Simultaneous datalink connection
    to Character Creator and iClone.\r\n    - Sending meshes from the Unity scene
    to iClone to aid scene specific animation.

    2.0.0 for all versions of Unity 2020.3 to 6000.0 and all pipelines (HDRP / URP

    this with the package manager. It should also work if just dropped into Assets.\r\n\r\nThis
    package will install the shaders, template materials and run-time scripts into:
